    <!-- Array of ConnectivityManager.TYPE_{BLUETOOTH, ETHERNET, MOBILE, MOBILE_DUN, MOBILE_HIPRI,
         WIFI} values allowable for tethering.

         Common options are [1, 4] for TYPE_WIFI and TYPE_MOBILE_DUN or
         [1,7,0] for TYPE_WIFI, TYPE_BLUETOOTH, and TYPE_MOBILE.

         This list is also modified by code within the framework, including:

             - TYPE_ETHERNET (9) is prepended to this list, and

             - the return value of TelephonyManager.isTetheringApnRequired()
               determines how the array is further modified:

                   * TRUE (DUN REQUIRED).
                     TYPE_MOBILE is removed (if present).
                     TYPE_MOBILE_HIPRI is removed (if present).
                     TYPE_MOBILE_DUN is appended (if not already present).

                   * FALSE (DUN NOT REQUIRED).
                     TYPE_MOBILE_DUN is removed (if present).
                     If both of TYPE_MOBILE{,_HIPRI} are not present:
                        TYPE_MOBILE is appended.
                        TYPE_MOBILE_HIPRI is appended.

         For other changes applied to this list, now and in the future, see
         com.android.networkstack.tethering.TetheringConfiguration.

         Note also: the order of this is important. The first upstream type
         for which a satisfying network exists is used.
